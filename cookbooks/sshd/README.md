# sshd

TODO: Enter the cookbook description here.

This cookbook will only check if the OS is 'CentOS' it would try to see if version 6 or 7, based on that you can customize your sshd_config / ssh_config and can harden.
this would make your openssh server to re-read any fix required and so on.. etc
